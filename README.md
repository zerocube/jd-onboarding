# JuniorDev Presenter Onboarding Site

This repository hosts the content for the presenter onboarding experience located at
https://www.zerocube.com.au/jd-onboarding

## How it Works

The contents of the `site` directory are pulled down from GitHub every time the site is deployed.

The pages are loaded into Gatsby, which will convert the markdown and images into web content.

## Content

The aim is to use locally-referenced material (e.g. images), so that we can preview the content with built-in markdown
previewers, such as the one available in `vscode`.
