# OBS - Screen Share

We use OBS to capture your screen, and send it to the studio. Typical use cases for this include a code demo.

## Create / set the scene

1. In the scenes panel, click the '+' button

2. Give it a name! We recommend something easy to recognise, e.g. "Screen Share"
3. Under the `Sources` pane, click the '+' button, and add a `Display Capture` - Feel free to give this a name, but you
   don't have to

_Please note: if you're using macOS Catalina or newer, you may need to tick the check box next to OBS in [System Preferences here](x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_ScreenCapture) to be able to see your screen in OBS_

4. Select the display you want to capture. It's recommended to use a second display to share, so that you have a
   display handy for the video call (if any), or live chat.
   Checking the `Capture cursor` box will make the mouse cursor visible.
5. In the main preview window, the preview window may show a 'zoomed in' part of your display. If it does:
    1. Ensure the preview isn't locked. Right click the preview window and make sure `Lock Preview` is unchecked
    1. Right click on a visible part of the display capture element, and select `Transform -> Fit to screen`

If you do need to send audio via OBS (e.g. as part of a presentation or video), please let us know in advance.
